# HopDot

HopDot is a web application that helps runners map custom running routes between two locations, passing through required waypoints and matching a target distance. Itâ€™s ideal for runners who want precision in training routes or want to explore new paths with specific goals in mind.

ðŸ™‚ This web version serves as a prototype of the core functionality before full Garmin Connect IQ integration.
